a) We ran 'H1 ping -c 100 H2'.
   The average RTT time was 29.846 ms. The first packet takes 17.6 ms to be delivered. The average of hub controller is at 29.179 ms. We can see that there is no difference
   in the performance of the two implementations. This makes sense since this is a very simple topology. Each switch has 2 ports with two other switches. In the hub impleme    ntation we flooded the packet to all ports except the port that it came through. This means that  

b) We ran 'H1 ping -c 100 H5'.
   The average RTT was : 32.504 ms.

   Compared to 'H1 ping -c 100 H4' average RTT time which is 34.386 ms it is of cours very similar because the distance of both H4 and H5 from H1 is the same (4 hops).

c) Next we ran an iperf instance as before, with H1 being the iperf server and H5 the iperf client.

   The throughput this time was 2.85 Mbits/sec.

   Compared to the Hub Controller, the throughput is higher, since a lot of bandwidth that was lost due to the floodings is now utilized.
