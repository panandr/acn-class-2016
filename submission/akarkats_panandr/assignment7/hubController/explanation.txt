a) We ran 'H1 ping -c 100 H2'.
   On average of the 100 packets it takes 27.203 ms per RTT.
   Because our controller makes the virtual switches act as simple hubs that just flood any receiving   packet, this ping alone results in traffic generated in all flow and switch interfaces.
   Attached is also a plot of the RTT per ping.

b) We ran 'H1 ping -c 100 H5'.
   The average RTT now is 32.686 ms which is a bit larger than the first occasion since the hosts H1    and H2 are closer than H1 and H5.

c) We then performed 'pingall'. The output is:

   mininet> pingall
   *** Ping: testing ping reachability
   h1 -> h2 h3 h4 h5
   h2 -> h1 h3 h4 h5
   h3 -> h1 h2 h4 h5
   h4 -> h1 h2 h3 h5
   h5 -> h1 h2 h3 h4
   *** Results: 0% dropped (20/20 received)

   This confirms that all hosts are pingable.

d) We then tested the performance of the networm by running iperf on a pair of hosts (h1, h5):

   h1> iperf -s            # h1  will be our iperf server.

   h5> iperf -c 10.0.0.1   # h5 will be our iperf client.

   The reported throughput for the client was : 1.85 Mbits/sec
